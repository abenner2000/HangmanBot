# HangmanBot
Selenium Project for automating Hangman game I developed

You can download this project and if you have selenium installed on your local machine everything should work fine. The goal of this project is to access my published Hangman 
game and attempt to beat it using automation. First it guesses all five vowels in the alphabet and then it goes on to guess the remaining letters in the alphabet (without
repeating any guesses) until the game is won or lost.
